This script uses the turtle graphics library to create various colorful patterns and art, including polygons, random walks, spirographs, and a Damien Hirst-inspired dot painting using colors extracted from an image.

Functions
1. all_gons()
Draws regular polygons from triangles (3 sides) up to decagons (10 sides), each in a different color from the colors list.

Turtle shape: "turtle"
Colors: Cycles through a predefined list.
Behavior: Resets heading before each polygon.
2. random_wals()
Creates a random walk pattern with the turtle, using random RGB colors for each segment.

Turtle shape: "turtle"
Pen size: 10
Speed: Fastest
Color: Random RGB for each step
Movement: 50 units forward, then a random turn (0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees)
Steps: 5000
3. spirograph()
Draws a spirograph by repeatedly drawing circles and rotating the heading.

Turtle shape: "turtle"
Speed: Fastest
Color: Random RGB for each circle
Circles: 100, each rotated by 3.6 degrees
4. damien_hirtz(image: str, n: int)
Creates a grid of colored dots inspired by Damien Hirst, using colors extracted from an image.

Turtle shape: "turtle"
Speed: Fastest
Start position: (-200, -200)
Colors: Extracted from the given image using color_extractor.extract_colors
Grid: 10x10 dots
Dot size: 20
Spacing: 50 units between dots
Color selection: Random from extracted palette, sorted by red value
